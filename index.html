                    <p>In Technology Class this year, we have been able to learn a lot. First, we learned about image manipulation. This is where you can use Photoshop or GIMP and edit the image. Second, we learned about HTML coding. This is where you can code websites like this using HTML, CSS, or what you see right now, Bootstrap. Third, we learned 3D modeling. This was where you could make 3D object in programs like Blender. Finally, we learned Unreal Engine, which is a game development program that makes lots of cool video games. Some goals that I have for 8th grade is to learn Javascript really well and be able to be really good at Javascript, and improve my 3D modeling skills.</p>

                    <p>In the HTML unit, this is the part where we had to create 2 different websites using HTML and CSS off of 2 school units. The two websites below are a film review of <i>Everest</i> (2015) and an astronomical website about the dwarf planet Pluto. Here are images of the websites here.</p>
